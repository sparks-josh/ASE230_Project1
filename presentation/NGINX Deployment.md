## Overview:

The goal of this part of the project was to deploy the REST APIs with **NGINX** in accordance to the following constraints: 
- Deployment steps/tutorial documented in Marp slide (and converted into PDFs)
- full points if marp file is made with screen captures, no partial points
- A screen capture of your NGINX server working should be included 
- Saved in `presentation/` directory
